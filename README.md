# Leddit

The project aims to develop a sophisticated forum social network application where users can submit content such as images, links and text posts which can then be commented on by other users. And these posts which can be voted on by users are organised into sub communities called subreddits. Users can submit posts and comments without registration while members will have the additional ability to create subreddits and act as their moderators. Admins can ban users, delete posts and create other admins.

### Key Features include:

User Management: Users can register, log in and view their profiles. Admins can delete posts, ban users and manage admins.

Subreddit Management: Users can create subreddits and act as its moderator.

Post Management: Users can submit and view posts with the ability to submit images with them.

Comment Management: Users can submit and view comments.

Database Integration: Images and text content are stored together into the database along with user authentication tokens.

Vote Management: Posts can be upvoted or downvoted by users.

Spring Boot Application: The application is built with Spring Boot while following the MVC architecture.
